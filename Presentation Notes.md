Need: A way for people to sell and buy clothing, auction valuable/limited edition items. 

There is no clothing-specific web app that shows both listings and auctions. They usually do one or the other. Our web app, Shufflewear, focuses mainly on clothing. It can resemble an Etsy style app for those that want to sell their own clothing. People can buy and sell different clothing brands or handmade clothes, hence "Shuffle"wear.
